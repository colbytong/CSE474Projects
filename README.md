# CSE474Projects
Projects I have built in the UW CSE 474 class while learning the fundamentals of embedded systems.
All programs included are configured for the Texas Instruments TM4C123GH6PM ARM Cortex-M microcontroller.
Modules used in the programs include GPIO, Timers, Interrupts, ADC, PLL, and RTOS.
